GAME OBJECTIVE:

The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships.
All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board.  You try and hit them by calling out the 
coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling
out coordinates. Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess 
where they are. Each player in the game has grid on which he/she will place the ships.

STARTING A NEW GAME:
Each player places the number of ships given to them somewhere on their board.
The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally.
Diagonal placement is not allowed. 
No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board. 
Ships may not overlap each other.
No ships may be placed on another ship. 

Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.

The 2 type of ships are:  cargo-ship(3), Submarine (2).  

PLAYING THE GAME:
Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate.
Both players will mark their board with: HIT or MISS. For example, if you call out A:5 and your opponent does not have 
any ship located at A:5, your opponent would respond with "miss".  
You record the miss A:5 will be place in your history list and you can also see Your opponent records of attempts to hit.

When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be DESTROYED. 
You will announce "HIT AND DESTROYED".

As soon as all of one player's ships have been DESTROYED, the GAME IS OVER.
